# UK energy mix
This study investigates the variation of electricity generation from different sources in the UK
between years 2009 and 2023. Analysis was made by implementing Python code to analyse the
Historic Generation Mix & Carbon Intensity data from the National grid ESO website. The analysis
focuses on the changes of electricity generation for different energy sources, including gas, coal,
nuclear, wind and solar. The research results show the considerable increase in electricity
generation from alternative sources like wind and solar and decrease in usage of gas and coal,
which is related to environmental policies and government goal of becoming Net-Zero by 2050.
